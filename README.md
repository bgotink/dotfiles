Configuration to turn a macOS environment into something that fits my expectations:

- Install Homebrew and use that to install a bunch of tools & applications
- Install FISH and configure that as default shell
- Replace (some) BSD commands with GNU versions
- Link configuration files to files in this repo
- &hellip;

## Setting up

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `./setup.sh`
3. Install the `Chalk.terminal` theme: `open extra/Chalk.terminal` and configure `Terminal.app` to use chalk as theme and FISH as shell
